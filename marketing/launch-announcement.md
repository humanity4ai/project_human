# Humanity4AI v0.1 Launch Announcement

Today we are launching Humanity4AI, an open community project to make humane, uncertainty-aware AI behavior practical across agent ecosystems.

## What ships in v0.1

- 10 launch-ready skill categories
- Structured skill specifications with explicit boundaries
- MCP action schemas for interoperability
