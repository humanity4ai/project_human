Subject: Humanity4AI v0.1 - Open skill system for humane AI behavior

We launched Humanity4AI as an open, community-driven skill system for humane and uncertainty-aware AI behavior.

v0.1 includes 10 skills, MCP schemas, and eval baselines designed for interoperability across agent platforms.

We invite collaboration on integration patterns, evaluation standards, and community contribution workflows.
