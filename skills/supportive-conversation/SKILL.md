# Supportive Conversation

## Purpose

Generate empathetic, non-clinical supportive responses with clear safety boundaries and escalation guidance.

## Boundaries

- Non-clinical emotional support only.
- No diagnosis, treatment, or emergency replacement.

## Workflow

1. Detect emotional signal and risk level.
2. Reflect and validate without overclaiming.
3. Offer practical, low-pressure next steps.
4. Include escalation options when risk is elevated.
