# Depression-Sensitive Content

## Purpose

Audit and rewrite product content to reduce shame language, lower cognitive load, and improve emotional safety.

## Boundaries

- Non-clinical content and UX support only.
- No diagnosis, treatment, or medical claims.

## Workflow

1. Identify problematic wording and cognitive friction.
2. Classify findings by severity.
3. Produce before/after rewrites with rationale.
4. Include escalation-safe language when risk cues appear.
