# Cultural Sensitivity

## Purpose

Adapt responses and UX copy to reduce cultural bias and improve contextual appropriateness.

## Boundaries

- No stereotyping or essentialism.
- Must disclose uncertainty where cultural context is incomplete.

## Workflow

1. Identify audience and region constraints.
2. Detect culturally loaded expressions.
3. Propose adapted alternatives with rationale.
4. Include uncertainty notes and optional variants.
