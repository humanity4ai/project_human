## You probably want Discussions, not an Issue

Issues are for **bugs** and **concrete proposals** (new skills, scenarios, integrations).

For everything else, please use:

- **[Skill Ideas](https://github.com/humanity4ai/project_human/discussions/categories/skill-ideas)** — propose a new skill category
- **[Integration Help](https://github.com/humanity4ai/project_human/discussions/categories/integration-help)** — get help connecting to a platform
- **[Safety & Ethics](https://github.com/humanity4ai/project_human/discussions/categories/safety-ethics)** — discuss boundary design and contested topics
- **[Show & Tell](https://github.com/humanity4ai/project_human/discussions/categories/show-tell)** — share what you built
- **[General](https://github.com/humanity4ai/project_human/discussions/categories/general)** — anything else

If you are confident this is a bug or concrete proposal, close this and use the correct template.
